In the second part of this workshop we will use the tool "Edge Impulse" to create and train a machine learning model and run it on an edge device. Edge Impulse is a tool in the browser with numerous integrations and extensions to communicate with your edge devices and use your own tools for data creation, model creation, inference settings etc.

## Goal of the project

We want to mount the STM Sensortile module on a pen(cil) and detect which letters (or numbers) the user is writing on a piece of paper using the on-board accelerometer.
